# Doom Elixir treesit module

This is a copy of the Doom emacs elixir module that uses
[elixir-ts-mode](https://github.com/wkirschbaum/elixir-ts-mode) instead of
elixir-mode.

You need to have Emacs 29 with treesit support.

To use it copy the `module` directory to your `DOOMDIR` and add elixir to your
modules in `init.el` as if you were using the built-in elixir module.
